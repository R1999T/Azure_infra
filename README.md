# Azure_infra
HELLO there!

In this repository I am gonna share basic infrastructures on Azure cloud using Terraform

Why Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?
To better understand the advantages of Terraform, it helps to first understand the benefits of Infrastructure as Code (IaC). IaC allows developers to codify infrastructure in a way that makes provisioning automated, faster, and repeatable. Itâ€™s a key component of Agile and DevOps practices such as version control, continuous integration, and continuous deployment.


NOTE: if you want to use the code from this repository first create <main.tf> file and then copy the code to that file before running any infrastructure
